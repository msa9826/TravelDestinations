This is a react-js application for client programming course. Features are incrementally added with bug fixing, improving business logic and UX.

This is a mix of Extreme Programming and Iterative/Incremental Development inorder to meet milestones.

The goal is to explore React for example useState Hook.

Currently, exploring Modularity.


I hope you enjoy or suggest :)
